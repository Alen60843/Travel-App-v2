/**
 * Proves the outbox pipeline is OPERATIONAL, not merely implemented.
 *
 * Every other outbox test drives the relay by calling `tick()` directly, which
 * verifies the algorithm but says nothing about whether anything runs it in a
 * deployed process. This test boots the real worker composition root
 * (`WorkerModule`, the same module `worker.ts` boots) and then never touches
 * the relay again — the row must travel
 *
 *     job_outbox → relay poll loop → BullMQ → worker → completed_at
 *
 * entirely on its own. If the relay were not scheduled, or no worker consumed
 * the queue, this test hangs and fails rather than passing on a technicality.
 *
 * That second failure mode is the one that actually bit during Phase 2: the
 * relay published correctly and `published_at` was set, but nothing consumed
 * the queue, so `completed_at` stayed NULL forever. Asserting on
 * `completed_at` rather than `published_at` is the whole point of this file.
