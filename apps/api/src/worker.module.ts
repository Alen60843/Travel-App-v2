/**
 * Composition root for the **worker deployable**.
 *
 * This is a separate process from the HTTP API, sharing its code but not its
 * runtime. Two reasons, both from the Phase 1 architecture:
 *
 *   1. A burst of background work must not contend with request latency. The
 *      relay claims rows and publishes to Redis in a loop; job processors do
 *      arbitrary work. Neither belongs on the event loop serving users.
 *   2. They scale on different signals. Web replicas scale with request rate;
 *      workers scale with queue depth. Coupling them means overprovisioning
 *      one to satisfy the other, and it means every autoscaled web replica
 *      adds another poller against `job_outbox`.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: no controllers, no Socket.IO gateway, no HTTP server.
 * The worker consumes queues and drives the relay; it serves nothing.
